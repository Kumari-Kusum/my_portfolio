                    Learning HTML can provide tremendous value to people working in tech, as well as to those who are running their own business or managing a website. Even if you just want to create an online portfolio for your work, HTML can be a fantastic skill to have in your repertoire.

                <h2>Learn CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    A website can run without CSS, but it certainly isn't pretty. CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.

                <h2>Learn JAVASCRIPT</h2>
                <p>
                    The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven't got your heart set on a tech career, being proficient in this language will enable you to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in today's job market!
                    JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python, Java, or C++.
